#  Store Performance Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project explores a dataset containing store-level details to build classification models that predict store performance. The analysis includes metadata understanding, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

##  Contents

- `FinalMLproj.ipynb`: Main notebook with data exploration, preprocessing, and ML models.
- `storedata.csv`: Dataset containing store characteristics and performance labels.
- `FinalMLproj_annotated.ipynb`: Annotated version of the notebook with detailed comments and markdown for clarity.

---

## Dataset Overview

Each row in the dataset represents a store, with features like:

- **Demographics**: Population within drive-time zones.
- **Store Characteristics**: Floor space, staff, clearance space, etc.
- **Competition**: Number and quality of nearby competitors.
- **Target**: `Performance` (Good/Bad)

---

## üîç Project Goals

- Understand how different features relate to store performance.
- Apply various classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, etc.).
- Identify the best-performing model.
- Provide business insights into which factors most influence performance.

##  How to Run

1. Upload `storedata.csv` to  Google Drive.
2. Open `FinalMLproj.ipynb` in Google Colab.
3. Run all cells sequentially.
